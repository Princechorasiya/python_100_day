#randomisation and pythons lists

#Randomisation:useful when we want to create programs with certain degree of unpredictiablity.
#eg games.
#computer are deterministic:perform repeatablet tasks in afully predictable manner.
#pyhton uses Mersenne twister pseudo number generator.
#pyton already has random module.
import random
random_integer=random.randint(1,10)
print(random_integer)

#module
#split the lagre  code into individual module responsible for particular a part/action
#like when builidng a car we produce different parts at different palces.
#large project we can collabrate with differnet people creating different modules.
#Random module for randomisation.
#to create a module create a new file other than main file then work on it.
#come back to the main file and use import
